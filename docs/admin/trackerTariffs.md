## Creating a New Tracker Tariff

1. Go to the ***Create New Tariff*** tab.
2. Choose whether the tariff will be general or individual.

- If the tariff is general, it will be available to all platform users for selection.
- If the tariff is individual, the Administrator must select the user from the dropdown list who will have access to this tariff. Other users will not be able to use it.
